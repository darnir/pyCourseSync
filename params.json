It provides the simplest and\r\n     easiest HTTP Client API I have ever seen.\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n=====\r\n\r\n```\r\nusage: CourseSync.py [-h] [-a | -d | -r] [-S] [-v {q,v,d}] [-l]\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -a, --add-courses     Add courses to your Course List\r\n  -d, --delete-courses  Remove courses from your Course List\r\n  -r, --reset           Delete your Course List file and start a new one.\r\n                        Helpful when starting a new semester\r\n  -S, --sync            Sync your machine with the CMS Servers\r\n  -v {q,v,d}, --verbosity {q,v,d}\r\n                        Change verbosity of script output\r\n  -l, --view-logs       View the contents of your Log File\r\n```\r\n\r\nUsing pyCourseSync is very easy. Use the --add-courses or --delete-courses to\r\nchange what data is synced from the CMS.\r\n\r\nThen leave this script in your startup applications so that it syncs with the\r\nCMS on every system startup. In case you leave your system ON for multiple days,\r\nset up a scheduled task to execute pyCourseSync.\r\n\r\nThe verbosity and logging options are currently not implemented and will\r\nhopefully be implemented soon, by V1.0\r\n\r\nCredits\r\n=======\r\n\r\nThe original CourseSync client was written by Vishwajit Kolathur and Aravind\r\nPedapudi in Perl and can be found at: https://github.com/ajit-kolathur/CMS\r\nThis was the inspiration based on which pyCourseSync is written.\r\n\r\nAuthors\r\n=======\r\n\r\n   * Darshit Shah  <darnir@gmail.com>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
