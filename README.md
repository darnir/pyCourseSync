Dependencies
============

pyCourseSync uses some of the best libraries available for Python 3 to accomplish the task.
The libraries required for pyCourseSync to work are:
1. BeautifulSoup4: This is an absolutely amazing library for parsing and navigating Web Pages.
2. Requests: This stunningly simple library was chosen over the built-in urllib library after a lot of consideration. It provides the simplest and easiest HTTP Client API I have ever seen.
